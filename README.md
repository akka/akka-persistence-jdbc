akka-persistence-jdbc writes journal and snapshot entries to a configured JDBC store. It implements the full akka-persistence-query API and is therefore very useful for implementing DDD-style 
application models using Akka for creating reactive applications.

## Documentation

* [Akka Persistence JDBC 3.5.x documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-jdbc/3.5/)
