   * `eventsByPersistenceId` is used to retrieve a stream of events for a particular persistenceId.
   *
   * The `EventEnvelope` contains the event and provides `persistenceId` and `sequenceNr`
   * for each event. The `sequenceNr` is the sequence number for the persistent actor with the
   * `persistenceId` that persisted the event. The `persistenceId` + `sequenceNr` is an unique
   * identifier for the event.
   *
   * `fromSequenceNr` and `toSequenceNr` can be specified to limit the set of returned events.
   * The `fromSequenceNr` and `toSequenceNr` are inclusive.
   *
   * The `EventEnvelope` also provides the `offset` that corresponds to the `ordering` column in
   * the Journal table. The `ordering` is a sequential id number that uniquely identifies the
   * position of each event, also across different `persistenceId`. The `Offset` type is
   * `akka.persistence.query.Sequence` with the `ordering` as the offset value. This is the
   * same `ordering` number as is used in the offset of the `eventsByTag` query.
   *
   * The returned event stream is ordered by `sequenceNr`.
   *
   * Causality is guaranteed (`sequenceNr`s of events for a particular `persistenceId` are always ordered
   * in a sequence monotonically increasing by one). Multiple executions of the same bounded stream are
   * guaranteed to emit exactly the same stream of events.
   *
   * The stream is not completed when it reaches the end of the currently stored events,
   * but it continues to push new events when new events are persisted.
   * Corresponding query that is completed when it reaches the end of the currently
   * stored events is provided by `currentEventsByPersistenceId`.

  /**
   * Query events that have a specific tag.
   *
   * akka-persistence-jdbc has implemented this feature by using a LIKE %tag% query on the tags column.
   * A consequence of this is that tag names must be chosen wisely: for example when querying the tag `User`,
   * events with the tag `UserEmail` will also be returned (since User is a substring of UserEmail).
   *
   * The consumer can keep track of its current position in the event stream by storing the
   * `offset` and restart the query from a given `offset` after a crash/restart.
   * The offset is exclusive, i.e. the event corresponding to the given `offset` parameter is not
   * included in the stream.
   *
   * For akka-persistence-jdbc the `offset` corresponds to the `ordering` column in the Journal table.
   * The `ordering` is a sequential id number that uniquely identifies the position of each event within
   * the event stream. The `Offset` type is `akka.persistence.query.Sequence` with the `ordering` as the
   * offset value.
   *
   * The returned event stream is ordered by `offset`.
