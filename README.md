# Akka Persistence JDBC

The Akka family of projects is managed by teams at [Lightbend](https://lightbend.com/) with help from the community.

akka-persistence-jdbc writes journal and snapshot entries to a configured JDBC store. It implements the full akka-persistence-query API and is therefore very useful for implementing DDD-style 
application models using Akka for creating reactive applications.

Please note that the H2 database is not recommended to be used as a production database, and support for H2 is primarily for testing purposes.
