   * A consequence of this is that tag names must be chosen wisely: for example when querying the tag `User`,
   * events with the tag `UserEmail` will also be returned (since User is a substring of UserEmail).
   *
   * The consumer can keep track of its current position in the event stream by storing the
   * `offset` and restart the query from a given `offset` after a crash/restart.
   *
   * For akka-persistence-jdbc the `offset` corresponds to the `ordering` column in the Journal table.
   * The `ordering` is a sequential id number that uniquely identifies the position of each event within
   * the event stream.
   *
   * The returned event stream is ordered by `offset`.
   *
   * The stream is not completed when it reaches the end of the currently stored events,
   * but it continues to push new events when new events are persisted.
   * Corresponding query that is completed when it reaches the end of the currently
   * stored events is provided by [[CurrentEventsByTagQuery#currentEventsByTag]].
